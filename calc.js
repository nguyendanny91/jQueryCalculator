// Vu - filter logic to create 3 arrays
  array 1 - firstNumberArray - Vu
  array 2 - secondNumberArray - Vu
  array 3 - Operator - Vu
  var 4 - errorFlag - boolean

// Ashley record function keyp presses
// on button press - capture button presses

// Dnyn - display first number array, second number, array, Result

// Chuck - combine arrays to create 'whole numbers'
  firstNumber
  secondNumber
  Result



// Danny display user InputNumbers
  // if user hits 2 operators then error

// Ashley will create the array [1,2,3,"+","4"]
  logic to only allow numbers entered first, followed by operator, followed by number

// Chuck you'll formulate the calculations using  and populate into result variables
  var 1 - firstnumber
  var 2 - secondNumber
  var 3 - operator
  var 4 - result






var InputNumbers = [1,2,3,"+","4","="];
var FormulaArray = [123,+,4]
var DisplayAnswer = "";

var firstNumber = array
var secondNumber = array
var operator = array
var result

firstNumber, secondNumber, operator, result


// recordkeystrokes
  // only allow users to select numbers in the begining populate in firstnumber
  // if user selects operator then populate operator
  // only allow users to select numbers


// Ashley create array that will record button presses

// Chuck will create the answer - needs to use Ashley's array

// Display Buttons Selected /* DNYN */
//123 --
//+
//4
//=



//user selects button only numbers allowed on the top starpower
// when user enters an operator then new row is created and operator is populated
// when user enters next set of numbers then repeat



/* array is created to include all buttons in order .. first element is 1 and element is 2



/* display 1 ,2 ,3 , and last number in third starpower

/* from array transform mathmetic formula




For the next 30 minutes, your goals should be to:

Begin creating sets of variables that you think you will need. As a few suggestions:

firstNumber, secondNumber, operator, result
Create code that captures the numbers from button clicks, and then displays them on the HTML.

Create code that captures an operator click, then immediately tells your code to begin recording the second number. (Example: If a user clicks the “plus” button, you know they are done typing the first number).

Create code that checks which operator the user has clicked, then saves this operator for later use in a conditional statement. (Example: If a user clicks the “plus” button, you know you will need to be adding two numbers. If a user clicks the “minus” button, you will need to be subtracting two numbers. Think: if-else statements!)
